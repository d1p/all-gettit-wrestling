# all-gettit-wrestling
A python script to download the latest wrestling show.
Just for educational purpose only. 

This package is a collection of functions to browse pirate-bay for the latest wrestling show.

## Installation

pipenv install
```

## Usage
```
python main.py

### Note
I do not host, or create links for the shows itself. You can view this project as a html parser that searches the file for you automatically
